      may occur (such as when aerosol generating procedures are conducted in health
      care settings or potentially, in indoor crowded poorly ventilated settings elsewhere).
  utter_stop:
  - text: Self-care; If you feel sick you should rest, drink plenty of fluid, and
      eat nutritious food. Stay in a separate room from other family members, and
      use a dedicated bathroom if possible. Clean and disinfect frequently touched
      surfaces. And, Medical Treatment; If you have mild symptoms and are otherwise
      healthy, self-isolate and contact your medical provider or a COVID-19 information
      line for advice.
  utter_symptoms:
  - text: Common; fever, dry cough and, tiredness. Less common; aches and pains, sore
